# Temporal Workflow Demo

## Goals

The goals for the following demo is as follows:

1. Given a dataset of Tweets (in `csv`) with the following columns (`tweet`, `airlines`, `sentiment`) and the OpenAI SDK compute the average sentiment for a given airline, along with the accuracy of the prediction. 
2. Accuracy is measured between 0 and 1 and represents the ratio of the AI prediction to the labeled value in the dataset. A value of 1 represents a perfect mapping between the predicted airline name and sentiment against the test data.
3. The sentiment is represented as a signed float value between -1 and 1. This value is the ratio of the average sentiment to the total number of Tweets for the given airline. A negative value represents a negative sentiment, 0 for netural and positive for a postive sentiment.
4. The given workflow is described as a flow chart below:

    Start([Start Workflow]) --> ReadCSV["read_csv_activity

    ReadCSV --> ClassifyTweets{"Classify all tweets"}

    ClassifyTweets -->|for each tweet| ClassifyTweet["classify_tweet_activity

    ClassifyTweet --> StoreResults["Store Evaluation Result"]

    StoreResults --> CheckNextTweet{More tweets?}

    Calculate average sentiment"]
    ComputeAverage --> PrintResults["pretty_print_results_activity
    Print results and summary"]

    PrintResults --> End([End Workflow])
```

## Setup

1. Setup virtual env `python -m venv venv/` and `source venv/bin/activate`
1. Install dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Start the worker `python run_worker.py`
1. Start the temporal service `temporal server start-dev`
1. Run the workflow `python run_workflow.py`

## Technical Details

The Temporal workflow consists of the following activities:
- `read_csv_activity`: Read and parse the input dataset using `pandas`
- `classify_tweet_activity`: Use the OpenAI API to extract the airline name and sentiment (Positive, Negative or Netural).
- `compute_accuracy_activity`: Compute the accuracy of the prediction as per the rules described above
- `compute_average_sentiment_activity`: Compute the average sentiment as per the rules described above. This activity returns a `Dict[str, float]` representing the average sentiment per unique airline
- `print_sentiment_scores_table_activity`: Prints the average sentiment as a table sorted by the sentiment score.

In addition to the activities we also provide a few non-retryable errors for any OpenAI API failures:
- `OpenAIError`: Raised when OpenAI API call fails or model doesn't return usable output
- `InvalidJSONResponse`: Raised when response from OpenAI is not valid JSON
- `MissingPrediction`: Raised if prediction fields are empty or nonsensical

Failures may also be simulated by restricting network access and the workflow is able to successfully recover from this state. We also limit the total number of retries to 3 along with a strict timeout of 20 seconds to prevent backpressure on upstream services.

### Challenges
1. The AI model is subject to inconsistencies and in order to coerce the model the prompt must be specific in the return format required. We also provide a list of unique airline names to ensure that the model only returns a normalized value for comparison.
1. Debugging can often be complicated given the distributed nature of the worflow. When using a single worker the workflow can be straightforward but with distributed workflows things like handling rate limits and timeouts appropriately.
1. Size limits loading entire dataset with panads
1. The worker nodes would sometimes retain the previous version of the application logic and would require a restart to fetch the latest version.

## Example Output

Sentiment Accuracy: 87.00%

Airline Name Accuracy: 80.00%

Sentiment Scores by Airline:

| Airline          | Sentiment Score |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Virgin America   |           0.00  |
| Delta            |          -0.10  |
| Southwest        |          -0.11  |
| US Airways       |          -0.44  |
| American         |          -0.72  |
| United           |          -0.82  |



Result:
```
{"airline_accuracy":0.8,"sentiment_accuracy":0.87}
```

## Potential Improvements

1. **Create a Management Dashboard**: Develop a simple web interface that integrates with Temporalâ€™s API to monitor batch jobs, track costs, and visualize processing metrics.
1. **Implement Batching**: Instead of submitting each request to the API one at a time, create a queue system that builds batches of requests and use OpenAIs Batch endpoint for cost savings and efficiency
1. **Add Result Post-Processing**: Extend the workflow to include steps for processing and transforming batch results before storage or delivery to downstream systems.
1. **Build Webhook Notifications**: Implement a notification system that alerts services or users when batches complete processing.
1. **Optimize Polling Strategy**: Enhance the polling mechanism with exponential backoff and jitter to reduce unnecessary API calls while maintaining responsiveness.
1. **Add Database Integration**: Store batch results in a database with appropriate indexing for efficient retrieval and analysis.
1. **Implement Request Validation**: Add robust validation for incoming messages to prevent batch failures due to malformed requests.
1. **Performance Benchmarking**: Measure and optimize the performance of your batch processing system, potentially parallelizing certain operations for greater throughput.
